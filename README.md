# Kanchan Nath

Backend-focused web developer and engineering student. I build APIs and services that are simple, secure, and easy to maintain. I learn by building, reading real code, and contributing when possible.

## What I Work On

* REST APIs with Node.js and Express
* Authentication and authorization flows
* MongoDB and Mongoose data models
* Backend architecture for small to mid-size projects
* Debugging production-style issues and edge cases

## How I Approach Development

I care about clarity over cleverness. I prefer code that is readable, predictable, and easy to reason about six months later. I like understanding how things work under the hood instead of relying blindly on abstractions.

I usually start with a working baseline, then improve structure, error handling, and security step by step.

## Tech Stack

* **Languages:** JavaScript
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Auth:** JWT, bcrypt
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Postman

## Open Source and Learning

Most of my projects are learning-driven and based on real backend use cases. I study existing codebases, recreate features from scratch, and gradually refactor them to production-level quality.

I value clean commit history, clear naming, and honest documentation.

## Current Focus

* Writing safer authentication flows
* Improving API structure and error handling
* Understanding browser and backend security concepts
* Moving from tutorial-based code to self-designed systems
